# velociraptor-to-timesketch

**We will be working on making this a pre-baked AMI, but here are the deployment steps in the meantime <3**

**Note:** You may need to add/modify `fs.inotify.max_user_watches` in `/etc/sysctl.conf`. The default is 8192, and you may need to increase this number. Run `sysctl -p` after modifying.


### Deployment
* Deploy Timesketch instance - [Deployment Directions](https://github.com/google/timesketch/blob/master/docs/getting-started/install.md)
* python3/pip3, awscli, and inotify-tools are required
  ```
  apt install python3 python3-pip inotify-tools
  pip3 install --upgrade awscli
  ```
* Configure AWS CLI
  ```
  aws configure 
  ```
* Modify `bucket_name` in `watch-s3-to-timesketch.py` with S3 bucket name
* Modify `BUCKET_NAME` in `watch-plaso-to-s3.sh` with S3 bucket name
* Add Velociraptor artifact in Velociraptor and configure with AWS S3 bucket, region, and IAM credentials
